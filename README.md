  ## Description 
  Budget Tracker PWA is a budgeting tool that offers functionality even when the user is disconnected from the internet (progressive web application).  The user can add a transaction description and amount, which is either debited or credited from the total depending on button clicked.  In addition, the app contains a graph, so balance changes can be viewed over a period of time.  

  Behind the scenes, the app is utilizing indexed DB and a service worker to allow the user to continue adding transactions even if disconnected from the internet.  Once an internet connection is restored, the database is updated with all transactions added while offline.
